The application is built using the FastAPI framework and uses a PostgreSQL database with SQLModel as an ORM. The application can be deployed to Azure using the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview).

    ```sh
    python -m pip install -r demo_code/requirements.txt
    ```

1. Install the app as an editable package:

    ```sh
    python -m pip install -e demo_code
    ```

1. Apply database migrations and seed initial data:

    ```sh
    python3 demo_code/fastapi_app/seed_data.py
    ```

Run gunicorn on the app:

```sh
python3 -m gunicorn fastapi_app:app -c demo_code/gunicorn.conf.py
```
